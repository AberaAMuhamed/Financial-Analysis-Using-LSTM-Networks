# Financial-Analysis-Using-LSTM-Networks
It is noted that prediction of future prices movement has been a crucial area of research for a long period of time to predict the future prices movement and its trends or patterns with fairly high level  of accuracy.

Unlike traditional models, deep learning have several distinict advantages as non-parametric, self-learning, non-assumption and noise tolerant, which are unavailable in traditional models. Hence, deep learning might be more effective in forecating financial indicators say prices in comoarison to traditional models. Most datasets of prices might involve a mixture of long- and short-term information. LSTM networks that  could capture such information might be more accurate in the prediction of future prices movement.
